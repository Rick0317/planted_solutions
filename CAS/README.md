# Planted solutions
Generation of planted solution (i.e. exactly solvable) Hamiltonians and loading functions.

## Loading the Hamiltonians
### CAS-solvable
CAS-solvable Hamiltonians can be loaded by the module 'LOADER.py' under the folder "CAS". Requires `Openfermion` packages on python which can be added with `pip`. This code loads the precomputed CAS fragments with the given S_I orbital grouping as parameter k, and the molecule name mol.

## Generating CAS-solvable Hamiltonians for a molecule
CAS-solvable Hamiltonians can be generated by calling "cas-run.py" under the folder "run" with command line input of the molecule name.
python cas-run.py molecule
